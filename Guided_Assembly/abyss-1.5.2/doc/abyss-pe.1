.SH NAME
abyss-pe - assemble reads into contigs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B abyss-pe
[\fIOPTION\fR]...  [\fIPARAMETER\fR=\fIVALUE\fR]...  [\fIMAKE_TARGET\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Assemble the reads of the input files into contigs. The reads may be
in FASTA, FASTQ, qseq, export, SRA, SAM or BAM format and may be
compressed with gz, bz2 or xz and may be tarred.

abyss-pe is a Makefile script. Any options of make may also be used
with abyss-pe.

.SS "Parameters of abyss-pe"
.TP
\fBname\fR, \fBJOB_NAME\fR
The name of this assembly. The resulting scaffolds will be stored in
${name}-scaffolds.fa.
.TP
.B in
input files. Use this variable when assembling data from a single
library.
.TP
.B lib
a quoted list of whitespace-separated paired-end library names. Use
this varible when assembling data from multiple paired-end libraries.
For each library name in lib, the user must define a variable on
the command line with the same name, which indicates the read files for
that library. See \fBEXAMPLES\fR below for a concrete example of usage.
.TP
.B pe
list of paired-end libraries that will be used only for merging
unitigs into contigs and will not contribute toward the consensus
sequence.
.TP
.B mp
list of mate-pair libraries that will be used for scaffolding.
Mate-pair libraries do not contribute toward the consensus sequence.
.TP
.B long
list of long sequence libraries that will be used for rescaffolding.
long sequence libraries do not contribute toward the consensus sequence.

.B Q
minimum base quality [0]
.br
Mask all bases of reads whose quality is less than Q as `N'.
.TP
.B s
minimum unitig size required for building contigs (bp) [200]
.br
The seed length should be at least twice the value of k. If more
sequence is assembled than the expected genome size, try increasing s.
.TP
.B S
minimum contig size required for building scaffolds (bp) [s]
.TP
.B SS
SS=--SS to assemble in strand-specific mode
.br
Requires that all libraries are strand-specific RNA-Seq libraries.
Assumes that the first read in a read pair is reveresed WRT the
transcripts sequenced.
.TP
.B t
minimum tip size (bp) [2k]
.TP
.B v
v=-v to enable verbose logging
.TP
\fBnp\fR, \fBNSLOTS\fR

the program to use to align the reads to the contigs [map]
.br
map, kaligner, bwa, bwasw, bowtie or bowtie2
.TP
.B cs
convert colour-space contigs to nucleotide contigs following assembly
.SS "Options of make"
.TP
\fB-n\fR, \fB--dry-run\fR

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
Any parameter that may be specified on the command line may also be
specified in an environment variable.
.TP
.B PATH
must contain the directory where the ABySS executables are installed.
Use `abyss-pe versions` to check that PATH is configured correctly.

.SS "Scheduler integration"
ABySS integrates well with cluster job schedulers, such as:
 * SGE (Sun Grid Engine)

 * IBM LoadLeveler

The SGE environment variables JOB_NAME, SGE_TASK_ID and NSLOTS may be
used to specify the parameters name, k and np, respectively, and
similarly for other schedulers.
